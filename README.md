#Mushroom Classifier

This project was part of the Machine Learning 2 Class I took in the MSc in Business Analytics and Big Data.

Two models using the random forest algorithm were trained in order to predict wether a msuhroom is safe to eat or not. The models were deployed on streamlit:
[mushroom-classifier-jdc.streamlit.app]([https://example.com](https://mushroom-classifier-jdc.streamlit.app))

More details about the application and how it was trained can be found in the jupyter notebook.
